      text: ##Counselling  
      I practise using a Person Centred Approach and a blend of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, Positive Psychology, and Mindfulness. My Masters degree training and work experience enables me to practise as an integrative counsellor, utilising a range of therapeutic approaches depending on your needs and goals. I specialise in working with those experiencing addiction - both substance and process, disordered eating, and trauma. 
      
      ##Supervision 
      A positive, creative, reinforcing supervision style, We can collaboratively work toward growth and development, valuing openness, individuality, and learning.
