## Offering Clinical Supervision and Personal Therapy.
A positive, creative, reinforcing supervision style collaboratively working toward your growth and development, valuing individuality and openness.
I work using a Person Centred Approach often drawing on a blend of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, Positive Psychology, inner child work and Mindfulness. My Masters degree training and work experience enables me to practice as a integrative counsellor utilising a range of therapeutic approaches depending on your needs and goals.
This means that together we will explore your understanding and concerns, I will use a range of counselling skills through this process as we collaboratively explore and practice effective strategies that will help you to reach your therapeutic goals.
I specialise in working with those experiencing borderline personality disorder – also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder,  addiction – both substance and process, disordered eating, and trauma.

I offer consultations for individuals who want to explore, and improve their ability to manage emotion effectively, wish to enhance their relationship skills, and develop healthy and effective coping mechanisms whilst letting go of thinking/behaviour patterns that are having a detrimental effect in their lives.
